# python_email_sender

Simple program that helps you send emails quickly :fire:

### How to use it?

1. Enter content to *content.txt* and *content_html.txt*. First file contains fallback for e-mail clients that don't display HTML, for example for security reasons. If you don't want to enter subject just leave first line empty.
2. Edit sender's adress in *main.py*. You may have to turn "Allow less secure apps" on in your Gmail settings.
3. Run *main.py*, enter your password. **Hardcoding password is unrecommended.**

#### That's it.
